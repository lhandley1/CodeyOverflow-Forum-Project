# CodeyOverflow Forum Project
## Summary
My second React project assisted by Codecademy as part of the Learn React course. The task was to build and render profile comments with their profile pic, username and comments in three components.
- **Card** - the parent component for each forum comment
- **Header** – the first child of the Card component containing the profile pic and username.
- **Body** – the second child of the Card component containing the comment.
